  ## Description

  The Team Info Generator application uses the Command line interface to get information and creates an HTML file. If you need a quick and cool minimalistic style HTML file with your team's contact info, this application can produce that. Considering any future projects, I wanted to remove any tedious actions in contacting my team members. This application provides links to team member's email and other information such as Github profiles. The generated HTML file displays a simple, minimalistic webpage and also displays all the necessary information such as the position, employee ID, and more. This makes getting in touch with teammates quick and easy.
